                Krishna is a major deity in Hinduism. He is worshipped as 
                the eighth avatar of Vishnu and also as the Supreme God in 
                his own right.[14] He is the god of protection, compassion, 
                tenderness, and love;[15][1] and is widely revered among Hindu 
                divinities.[16] Krishna's birthday is celebrated every year by 
                Hindus on Krishna Janmashtami according to the lunisolar Hindu 
                calendar, which falls in late August or early September of the Gregorian calendar.

                The tradition of Krishna appears to be an amalgamation of several independent deities of ancient India, the earliest to be attested being Vāsudeva.[44] Vāsudeva was a hero-god of the tribe of the Vrishnis, belonging to the Vrishni heroes, whose worship is attested from the 5th–6th century BCE in the writings of Pāṇini, and from the 2nd century BCE in epigraphy with the Heliodorus pillar.

                Around 180 BCE, the Indo-Greek king Agathocles issued some 
                coinage (discovered in Ai-Khanoum, Afghanistan) bearing images 
                of deities that are now interpreted as being related to Vaisnava
                imagery in India.[48][49] The deities displayed on the coins 
                appear to be Saṃkarṣaṇa-Balarama with attributes consisting of the gada mace and the plow, and Vāsudeva-Krishna with attributes of the shankha (conch) 
                and the sudarshana chakra wheel.

                The Heliodorus inscription is not isolated evidence.
                The Hathibada Ghosundi Inscriptions, all located in the state of 
                Rajasthan and dated by modern methodology to the 1st century BCE, 
                mention Saṃkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva, also mention that the structure 
                was built for their worship in association with the supreme deity Narayana.
